# PORTFOLIO

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Undergraduate Research

As a double major in Quantitative Economics and Education, I was trained to be a mixed-method researcher. Below is the list of quantitative and qualitativeresearch projects I did in college using different methods.

### Quantitative Research

_Fall 2019_

Inspired by my summer internship at Chicago Public Schools (CPS)'s Department of STEM, I used regression to investigate how the Welcoming school program, a solution to the 2012-2013 massive school closure in Chicago Public Schools(CPS), affected the enrollment of the neighborhood public schools. Neighborhood public schools were identified using three few main criteria. Data of five years before and after the program implementation of those schools were collected and used in a Difference-in-Diffence model.

This paper was co-authored with Jackson Amodeo.

**Tools**: R, Ordinary Least Squares, Difference in Difference(DID), t-test

_Spring 2020_

Using logistic regression on a binary dependent variable - the probability of experiencing child mortality - this research found that there is a statistically significant impact of a woman’s years of completed general education, the ethnicity of her household’s head, whether she lives in rural areas. Education matters; however, its impacts fade away right after primary school. At the same time, findings also show the importance of contraception usage, HIV knowledge, as well as wealth in lowering the exposure to under-5 offspring death.

**Tools**: R, logistic regression models (logit), UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2014 data
