# PORTFOLIO
## Work Projects
I am a higher education researcher and data analyst with more than four years of professional work experience. In addition to my passion in data visualization and automation, I am venturing into predictive modeling. Since not all work projects that I have done can be shared publicly, below are a few examples of my work that were considered breakthroughs.

### [WAICU-member Alumni Employment Data on LinkedIn](https://www.wisconsinsprivatecolleges.org/waicu-alumni-employment-data/)
_View the dashboard by clicking the link above._

In order to showcase the impacts of private colleges and universities to the state of Wisconsin, I was asked to conduct a comprehensive LinkedIn research project. The whole project was conducted within about three months. I dedicated about 2-3 weeks to learn web scraping using R and then used the knowledge I gained to build an automated web scrapping tool in R. The data collected from the web scraping tool was then visualized in a PowerBI dashboard 

### [FAFSA Simplification Act and the Changes You Should Know (Presentation)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TlIsSyGL6JZ1zUQ3yJmWPlpCrEwJ0iws/view?usp=sharing)

I presented at the State National Information Network 2022 my research on FAFSA Simplication Acts and how the changes may impact state need-based aid spending. 

### [WAICU Graph of the Month](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/waicu/vizzes)
_View the full repository of past Graph of the Month by clicking the link above._

I initiated this Graph of the Month project with a goal to educate the public on current issues with higher education as well sa the different values of a college degree to an individual and a society. Starting in 2022, each month, there has been a graph with an interesting peace of data featured on WAICU social media.

## Undergraduate Research

As a double major in Quantitative Economics and Education, I was trained to be a mixed-method researcher. Below is the list of quantitative and qualitative research projects I did in college using different methods.

### Quantitative Research
#### [Women’s Education and its Impacts of Under-five Child Mortality in Vietnam](https://github.com/lelacelia/honors-thesis-U5Mortality/blob/main/Honors%20Thesis%20-%20U5%20Child%20Mortality.pdf)

_Spring 2020_

Using logistic regression on a binary dependent variable - the probability of experiencing child mortality - this research found that there is a statistically significant impact of a woman’s years of completed general education, the ethnicity of her household’s head, whether she lives in rural areas. Education matters; however, its impacts fade away right after primary school. At the same time, findings also show the importance of contraception usage, HIV knowledge, as well as wealth in lowering the exposure to under-5 offspring death.

**Tools:** R, logistic regression models (logit), UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2014 data

#### [Public School Crisis: Did Chicago Public Schools (CPS)’s Welcoming School Program Improve Enrollment?](https://github.com/lelacelia/ECON380-CPS-Welcoming-School/blob/main/Senior%20Sem%20-%20CPS%20Welcoming%20School.pdf)
_Fall 2019_

Inspired by my summer internship at Chicago Public Schools (CPS)'s Department of STEM, I used regression to investigate how the Welcoming school program, a solution to the 2012-2013 massive school closure in Chicago Public Schools(CPS), affected the enrollment of the neighborhood public schools. Neighborhood public schools were identified using three few main criteria. Data of five years before and after the program implementation of those schools were collected and used in a Difference-in-Diffence model.

This paper was co-authored with Jackson Amodeo.

**Tools:** R, Ordinary Least Squares, Difference in Difference(DID), t-test

#### [Income Inequality in OECD countries during 2005-2015](https://github.com/lelacelia/ECON303-income-inequal/tree/main)
_Fall 2019_

This research examines factors impacting income inequality in OECD countries from 2005 to 2015 measured by SWIID Gini Index with a focus on on the percentage of adults with higher education and total FDI as a proxy for globalization

**Tools:** STATA, Fixed Effect Models, 10-year panel data

### Qualitative Research
#### [From a Closed and Centralized to Market-based Economy: Comparing Education Policies of China (1978-1993) and Vietnam (1986-1996)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13oncKa1TF-2yxKwX3f7b_fRsjm5Ou7wH/view?usp=sharing)
_Fall 2018_

I applied International Comparative Education framework to elicitate the commonalities and differences in China and Vietnam’s education policies during drastic economic transition

#### [Teacher's Attitudes and Expectations on Students with Intellectual Disabilities in Postsecondary Transition Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jgzB8fgwNl2WCucr3PS45gNWDCANZMuE/view?usp=sharing)
_Fall 2018_

Through over 10 class observations, and multiple informal conversation with a High school special education teacher, I summarized the expectations of the teacher on her students with intellectual disabilities in terms of behavior, academic attainment and social skills. I analyzed the qualitative data and themes with a focus on finding the hidden curriculum to see how it could potentially affect the ID students’ post-secondary education outcomes

**Methodology:** Field observation, Informal Interviews, Narrative Research

#### [Internalized Gender Stereotype: Female College Students Reflect on Their K-12 Mathematics Experiences](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nPEkeowJ3OvXJ9SZU2EEpEaITSrQRqdd/view?usp=sharing)
_Spring 2019_

From five formal interviews, approximately 15-20 minutes each, I examined how the K-12 Mathematics education affected the ways female college students see Mathematics as a subject and as a possible career path.

**Methodology:** Formal Interviews with IRB Approval, Feminist Framework, Critical Pedagogy Theory
